# Code-of-Conduct

This is a Code of Conduct for the Nubian Finance Community. This is largely based on the [p5.js Code of Conduct](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and applies to all interactions on GitHub, Telegram and Discord.

**Be mindful of your language**. Any of the following behavior is unacceptable:

- Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background
- Threats of violence
- Deliberate intimidation
- Sexually explicit or violent material
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Stalking or following
- Or any other kinds of harassment

Use your best judgement. If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not post it.

**Be respectful**. Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone else's thoughts or opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care.

**Be considerate**. Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community and the cryptocurrency industry at large.

**Be open minded**. Embrace new people and new ideas you'll get to learn a lot when you do so. Our community is continually evolving and we welcome positive change.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, don't hesitate to notify any of our admins on Telegram or Discord.
